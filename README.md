This is our submission for IQM's challenge at iQuHACK 2026.

## Repo Structure && Important Files
The most important files to look out for can be found in the `working/` directory. Here you can see the two most important witnesses we used in `linear_witness.py` and `ghz_witness.py`. You can also take a look at some of the hardware optimization techniques we employed in `kruskal.py`, `dijkstra.py`, and `optimize.py`. `simulate.py` allows us to easily integrate the optimization methods with our witness implementations on quantum hardware.

You can also check out some of the other witnesses we tried to use in the `witnesses/` directory, as well as some variants of the witness algorithms we tried to implement. `calibration_data/` simply contains data from IQM's website and scripts for parsing data, and `visualization/` contains scripts for visualizing some of the data we gathered.
